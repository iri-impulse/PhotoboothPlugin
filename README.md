## Features

- Slide animation progress forward and backward, or step through frame by frame.
- Pick lighting colors with a color picker, and choose the light direction more intuitively.
- Adjust the character's head and eye direction precisely, without moving the camera.
- Visualize and manipulate the camera position and the camera pivot in a top-down view.

## FAQ

#### Q: This looks neat! How do I install it?

Install [XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/), and search for "Photobooth" in the plugin list once you're in game.

#### Q: Can I create portraits that would be impossible in the default UI?

No. Any portrait you make with this plugin could've been made with just the default UI, given patience, a good understanding of the camera, and good luck with the pause button.

## Tips and Tricks

Hover the (?) icon in the section headers for more information on the controls. Notably, on the top-down camera view:

- Shift + left-click dragging the camera rotates it around the pivot, without changing the distance.
- Right-click drag moves the camera and the pivot together.
- Shift + right-click drag rotates the camera and the pivot around the character, which effectively turns the character in place.

Remember, you can still use the regular portrait window controls for the things it does a good job at!
