# Photobooth

A Dalamud plugin for FFXIV that provides additional controls when editing a portrait.

## Features

- Slide animation progress forward and backward, or step through frame by frame.
- Pick lighting colors with a color picker, and choose the light direction more intuitively.
- Adjust the character's head and eye direction precisely, without moving the camera.
- Visualize and manipulate the camera position and the camera pivot in a top-down view.

## FAQ

#### Q: This looks neat! How do I install it?

Install [XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/), and ~~eagerly await this plugin's release in the testing channel, which you can enable in the "Experimental" tab of `/xlsettings`~~ stay tuned as I figure this out for the first time.

#### Q: Can I create portraits that would be impossible in the default UI?

No. Any portrait you make with this plugin could've been made with just the default UI, given patience, a good understanding of the camera, and good luck with the pause button.
